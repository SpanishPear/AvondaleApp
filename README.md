# AvondaleApp
HSC Software Design and Development timetabling App for Avondale School

# Discussion
One of the main struggles for students in high school is remembering their timetable, the order of subjects that they have in a day. 
If they don’t remember, then they have to spend time logging into the school learning portal and navigating their way to the timetable. Another issue is that the timetable is purely online, this means that when the school login portal is not letting a student log in, they have lost access to their student timetable.

The Avondale App aims to solve this problem by giving students quick easy, and offline access to their school timetable.
The app will make use of at least one array and several csv files to produce an application which will allow students to easily view their timetable. 
The minimum viable product(MVP) should consist of a login screen-where the user should be able to enter their student number, and a timetable screen which should be able to show the user’s timetable for Week A, and then be able to toggle to Week B if the user desires. 
Extra features, could be a “Bell Times” screen, which will display all information that the student needs: the current time, their current subject, what subject they have next, and when the bell goes. 
Another extra feature would be each of the subjects having the same colour in the timetable, and an additional feature on top of that would be to let users select colours for each subject.
This adds extra customisation to the app, giving it a more personal feel. Another added feature would be to have the timetable screen dynamic to any size of the app, this would make it so that users can always have it open and readable no matter the size of the application.
The Avondale App is targeted explicitly to year 11 students who attend Avondale school and will therefore make use of Avondale School’s colour scheme and style guide.
